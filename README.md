## 🎯 What You'll Learn

Go from **zero RL knowledge** to training your first intelligent agent in under an hour:

- **Core RL Concepts**: Agents, environments, rewards, and policies
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: How neural networks learn to make decisions
- **Practical Implementation**: Build DQN from scratch in PyTorch
- **Training Techniques**: Experience replay, target networks, and epsilon-greedy exploration

No PhD required—just curiosity and basic Python knowledge!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run in Google Colab

**Click the Colab badge at the top** ☝️ and run all cells (Runtime → Run all). Watch your agent go from random to expert in 10 minutes! 🎉

### Run Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install torch gymnasium imageio matplotlib numpy pillow

# Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook RL_PyTorch_Working.ipynb
```
